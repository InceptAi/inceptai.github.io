Your privacy is very important to us and the infomation collected by Wifi Tester
is purely used for diagnosing network issues in the user's network.

This privacy policy governs your use of the software application "Wifi
Tester” for mobile devices that was created by Incept AI LLC. Wifi Tester
allows users to diagnose the key issues with their wifi networks. It performs
speed tests, wifi scans and latency tests to different components of a wifi
network to pin-point the cause of slow internet and suggest possible fixes.

The key tests performed by Wifi Tester are as follows: 


- Bandwidth tests to figure out the end-user upload/download bandwidth.  
- Wifi scan to understand the congestion in the wireless spectrum and quality of wifi environment.  
- Ping tests to wireless routers, DNS, external web servers and other alternative DNS's
to ascertain if something is wrong with any single component.  
- Download latency test with the gateway to see the high level TCP latency.  
- Time spent in different wifi connection state like DHCP, Authentication etc.

Wifi tester looks at the aforementioned data and determines the key factors
affecting user's Internet connection. It then suggests fixes based on it.
Potential fixes could include -- changing your primary DNS, changing the
wireless channel, wireless router malfunction, cable modem fault, ISP is slow or
down or user is behind a captive portal which is preventing is from accessing
the Internet. It will then show this information to the user in a simple
intuitive way so even someone not familiar with the wifi network setup and
internals can understand and fix the issue.      

Wifi tester logs information about your Wifi network SSID, signal strength, ping
latencies to configured and public DNS servers and IP address used to access the
app to determine the ISP provider of the user. This information is used purely
for analyzing any potential issues with the user's wifi network.
